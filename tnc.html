        revenue, sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business, business interruption, loss of anticipated
        savings, loss of business opportunity) however caused, under any theory of liability, including, without

        employees, agents, suppliers and licensors relating to the services will be limited to an amount greater of one
        dollar or any amounts actually paid in cash by you to the Operator for the prior one month period prior to the
        first event or occurrence giving rise to such liability. The limitations and exclusions also apply if this
